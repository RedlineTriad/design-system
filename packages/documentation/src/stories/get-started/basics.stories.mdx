Check out what is new in the [Swiss Post Design System](/?path=/docs/misc-changelog--page).

If you are migrating from a previous version, please see the [migration guide](/?path=/docs/misc-migration--page).

## Prerequisites

This Swiss Post Design System documentation assumes you are familiar with Bootstrap and at least one of the following frontend technologies or frameworks:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
- Web Components [introduction](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) or [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components)
- [Angular](https://angular.io)

## Important HTML globals

Our Design System CSS uses some important global styles and settings that you'll need to be aware of when using it.

### HTML5 doctype

It requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

```html dark
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

### Responsive meta tag

It is optimized for mobile devices and scales up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>`.

```html dark
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no" />
```

### CSS box-sizing

For more straightforward sizing in CSS, the global box-sizing value is switched from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:

```css dark
.my-custom-selector {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
```

With the above snippet, nested elements - including generated content via `::before` and `::after` - will all inherit the specified `box-sizing` for that `.my-custom-selector`.

### Style reboot

For improved cross-browser rendering, Reboot is used to correct inconsistencies between different browsers and devices.
